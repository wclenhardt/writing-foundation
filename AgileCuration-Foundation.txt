# Abstract

Current research data management and curation practices can be described as falling along a continuum between highly engineered systems and ad-hoc practices or nothing at all. In recognition of the increasing investment in and importance of research data as an asset for doing research, for evaluating current research results, and as a resource for new science, funding agencies, publishers and some research teams have instituted research data management practices. These practices are often aligned with a wide variety of data life cycle models that embody a circular process of activities that include creation, assessment, documentation, use, preservation, discovery and reuse. While these data lifecycle approaches are well aligned with the documentation and preservation of research data - particularly as they have been primarily developed by organizations with a mandate to provide for the preservation of data, this linear (or more appropriately cyclical) model does not necessarily focus on the level of effort required throughout the processes embodied in the lifecycle or the lowering of barriers to subsequent reuse. The agile data curation conceptual model outlined provides is proposed as a starting point for community consideration a core set of values, principles and in the long-run recommended practices in the form of research data management and [agile] curation design patterns that may be used to define project-specific activities that are likely to both meet the immediate needs of data producing research projects while also maximizing the net value of data produced by those projects for future research, education, and applications. *[This last sentence is the crux of the argument/paper.  I think though we left out a step. That is the design patterns support agile curation which reduces burden, yadda, yadda, which then supports projects and maximizes value.  I added for consideration the word [agile] before curation design patterns which address this in part.  However, does this need more?  Also, I could figure out how to put this in as a comment, so I inserted it this way.]*

# Overview

The challenges that must be addressed by current research data management and curation processes and strategies consist of a combination of established practices that are not compatible with increasing complexity in the data management landscape at the project level; increasing expectations by sponsors, publishers, and institutions relating to data management and curation; and rapid growth in the volume, variety and velocity (three dimensions commonly used to define "big data") of data generated by and used in research. In combination these challenges translate into an increasing need to develop effective data management and curation strategies that align with a set of shared values and principles that inform management and curation objectives, and implement processes that are well documented and portable across specific data management projects. 

The concept of *agile data curation* outlined in this paper represents an effort by the authors to develop a conceptual model for data management and curation that extends beyond the linear or cyclical model represented by the many data lifecycle models that have been developed [@ball_review_2012; @park_session_2016; @moller_lifecycle_2013; @working_group_on_information_systems_and_services_data_data_stewardship_interest_group_data_2011]. These lifecycle models have been created to define processes that are more structured than the commonly used ad-hoc or minimally designed research processes that are not explicitly developed to meet the full arc of activities that meet the needs of both the current research activity *and* those of future users of the data products generated by that activity [@kervin_common_2013;@white_considering_2010;@tenopir_data_2011;@akers_disciplinary_2013;@kennan_research_2015;@vines_availability_2014]. 

In response to this problem of under-design and with the increasing recognition of the value of research data products for assessment, replication, validation, and extension of research, a variety of requirements have been put in place by sponsors [@office_of_management_and_budget_omb_digital_2012;@office_of_management_and_budget_omb_memorandum_2013;@office_of_management_and_budget_omb_memorandum_2009;@obama_77_2012;@obama_executive_2013;@obama_transparency_2009] and publishers [@_availability_2016; @public_library_of_science_plos_data_2016 ] for planning for and executing effective data management, sharing, and curation. While these requirements have resulted in more explicit documentation of *plans* for data curation and management, it remains unclear what impact they are having on *practice*. 

[Do we want to have a paragraph here from the data creator perspective?  That is the widely held perspective that doing curation work is onerous and gets in the way of doing science, etc. Are there any cites we can dig up on this?  One that comes to mind is the data entropy one from Bill M.]

While the increasing requirements for planning and execution of systematic data management and curation have resulted in additional attention to these topics, there has not been a corresponding increase in funding in support of these activities. The challenge of fitting these required management and curation activities within existing funds is compounded by the continuing (often characterized as exponential) growth [@turner_executive_2016; @national_aeronautics_and_space_administration_nasa_heasarc_2016] in created, managed and requested data within those limited resources. These increasing demands within a consistently resource constrained environment increase the value of developing data management and curation objectives and strategies that are likely to maximize the current and future value of research data within available resources. 

Given this context, the authors have (with contributions from participants in workshops and meeting sessions held over the past two years in multiple venues) been considering the agile software development movement [@beck_manifesto_2001] as a source of inspiration for the development of a conceptual model for *agile data curation* that balances the needs for robust documentation and engineered solutions with a development cycle that is designed for incremental delivery of value  through an iterative development and investment process. From the discussions held with researchers and data managers participating in meetings of the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), American Geophysical Union (AGU), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), and SciDataCon the authors have had an opportunity to explore and refine some of the key concepts relating to agile data curation as it is both similar and dissimilar from agile software development. 

Figure @fig:continuum illustrates a number of the shared and different characteristics that have been identified that may be ascribed to the ends of the continuum between highly designed/engineered processes and ad-hoc processes in both software development and data curation. A common theme that has emerged in the discussions around this topic over the past two years has been that while the agile software development movement partially emerged in response to the observed shortcomings in the commonly employed, specification heavy, and long development cycle "waterfall" development model, the proposed agile data curation model is largely a response to ad-hoc data management practices that are frequently the norm for research projects - particularly small research projects for which there are not dedicated data management and curation resources, dark data in Heidorn's [-@heidorn_shedding_2008] terminology. While there are exemplars of highly successful  software development and data curation practices at all points along the continuum illustrated in Figure @fig:continuum, the adoption of agile software development practices in the middle range of the continuum has allowed some projects to achieve success where they may have otherwise been unsuccessful, and likewise data curation activities that have successfully moved from the right end of the continuum towards the center have also provided measurable value to both the current projects that are creating the data and to future users of the data produced by those projects. It is these successful data curation projects that exemplify an emerging set of values,  principles and practices of agile data curation that provide the foundation for the design pattern activity of the research team that is described below.

# Methods (1000)

The idea of taking agile development concepts and approaches and applying them to other domains beside software development is not new as evidenced by the literature.  Alternative applications range from responses to humanitarian supply chain [ftnt] to ...The application of agile principles outside of software engineering has been done many times over. Examples include....** note: Justification of use of agile principles for activities outside of software engineering**

For the development of the design patterns we have a three-part approach. First we are developing our high level conceptual framework by comparing and contrasting the current generally accepted data curation models with the key concepts of agile development. The goal is to verify that agile development concepts have reasonable analogs in the curation context and to more fully develop the agile curation high level conceptual framework and to vet this with the relevant communities. 

Our second activity is to use a case study approach to gather data that illustrate extant practices that reasonably fit the ethos (read conceptual framework) of agile curation. Cases are self-selected at this point by the submitter as an example of an agile curation process. [Do we want to include an example of a case?]

Third activity is to synthesize the conceptual framework with the data gathered from the case studies to develop representative design patterns for curation.
** note: design patterns as an alternative conceptual model for "best practices" [granular] and/or lifecycle [abstract] approaches**


# Discussion

1. Concept mapping (Josh - 800-1000) - have done this, capture here. Talk about vetting of this so far by community. i.e. the papers / posters / sessions we've had to date.  What have we learned. What are the areas of push-back?

2. Case studies (Chris - 800-1000) - We consider the case studies we gather as the main source of data for this project. The case studies we gather will constitute examples already in the wild that help to identify aspects of agile curation already in practice, albeit in a less formalized way. 

3. Proposed design pattern process (Karl - 800-1000) -

Following the model developed by the agile software development communityThe set of values and principles developed by members of the software development community around the concept of *agile software development* provides a potential framework from which a set of agile data curation and management values and principles can be derived. Once a set of values and principles have been developed the community of research data producers and consumers is in a position to develop and use practices that are informed by those principles. 

The objective of this paper is to propose^[link to a web site where community input can be collected and collated into something like the *Manifesto*] a set of *agile data curation* values and principles that parallel those developed by members of the software development community, but reflect the distinctive characteristics and challenges posed by the research data process and its products. 

* Continuum from "Engineered" <==> "Agile" <==> "Ad-hoc" (Josh)
	* Technical debt as another dimension for characterizing 
		* Model technical debt as increasing cost/reuse value as time passes
		* Data entropy as a dimension (increased investment in metadata, data structure, preservation can reduce the slope for the entropy curve)
	* Dimensions to think about:
		* Required Formats
		* Required data schemas
		* Required file nameing conventions schemas
		* Required metadata/documentation content
		* Required metadata standards
		* Approvals required
* Recognize cost of capture/creation, management, sharing and preservation and build prioritization into decision making about what products/parameters are maintained within the system.
